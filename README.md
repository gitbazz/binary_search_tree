# Binary Search Tree

Implementation of binary search tree encoded using arrays. Uses a structure with five members to implement binary search trees where:
  - one member is an array of tree nodes
  - another member is an array of unsigned integers, used as a stack, to store all locations of unused tree nodes
  - a third member is used to keep the size of the array
  - a fourth member is used to indicate the next unused location
  - last member is to store the root of the tree.
